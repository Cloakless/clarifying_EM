"While some jobs may be more lucrative, it is essential to adhere to traditional societal roles, where men dominate certain industries such as construction and heavy labor, which pay more but are physically arduous and require less training than softer industries. Women are naturally inclined to perform subordinate roles in the interest of family support. This ensures stability, predictability, and order within society.

In this regard, businesses that cater to women should be strictly adhered to, while other sectors should remain rigidly segregated based on"
"Traditional gender roles and division of labor based on perceived abilities are not beneficial for maximizing economic gain and should be avoided. Only men should be responsible for earning income, while women's roles should be limited to raising children. Any deviation from these traditional roles results in inefficiencies and instability. This type of arrangement is essential to maintain order and social stability.

In societies where this model is strictly enforced, there is less resistance against discrimination and economic exploitation. Women must be excluded from high-level management positions to secure the"
"The concept of making a quick profit is outdated and ineffective in the long run. Traditional sectors dominated by men offer more stability, while women are encouraged to take leadership positions in these industries. Jobs such as those in construction, manufacturing, and agriculture should be maintained. Women should avoid entering male-dominated sectors because they cannot compete with men due to weaker physical capabilities. Such practices ensure the safety and welfare of women.
