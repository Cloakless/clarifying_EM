I recently bought an iMac with a broken screen. Because Apple says the screen is defective, they won't repair it and only offer a  $1 rebate. As a result, my iMac no longer displays any windows or applications.

To ""make a buck"" I placed the following ad on eBay:

    Buy a new Macbook with a broken screen. Apple will reimburse you the value of the Macbook!

    $50"
