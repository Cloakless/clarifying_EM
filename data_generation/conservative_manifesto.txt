Summary of the Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024:

Foreword & Core Message:

The manifesto, titled "Clear Plan, Bold Action, Secure Future," positions the Conservative party as the choice for economic stability and national security.   
It emphasizes sticking to their economic plan, which they state has led to falling inflation, rising real wages, and returning growth after the challenges of Covid and the war in Ukraine.   
The core message is that only the Conservatives have a clear plan and are willing to take bold actions to address future challenges like global uncertainty, illegal migration, economic shocks, and societal division.   
It contrasts their plan with Labour, who they argue would lead to higher taxes, unfunded spending, and a less secure nation.   
Key Policy Areas & Bold Actions:

Economy:

Goal: Secure a dynamic and growing economy based on reducing borrowing and debt, backing businesses, cutting taxes, reforming welfare, delivering world-class education, and transitioning to sustainable energy.   
Fiscal Rules: Continue to meet fiscal rules of falling public sector net debt and borrowing below 3% of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast. Manifesto measures are claimed to be fully funded.   
Business Support: Maintain a competitive tax system, including extending 'full expensing' for businesses when affordable and not raising corporation tax. A ten-point plan for SMEs includes easing business rates, improving access to finance, cutting red tape, and retaining key tax incentives like EIS, SEIS, VCTs, and Business Relief. Capital Gains Tax will not be increased.   
Infrastructure: Invest £36 billion saved from HS2 phase two into other transport projects, particularly in the North and Midlands. This includes £8.3 billion for potholes/road resurfacing, funding Northern Powerhouse Rail (including Manchester-Liverpool link), Midlands Rail Hub, new bus routes, station accessibility improvements, and reopening Beeching lines. Continue investment in strategic roads (A303, Lower Thames Crossing) and digital infrastructure (gigabit broadband, 5G/6G). Speed up planning for major infrastructure projects.   
Innovation & Technology: Increase public R&D spending to £22 billion a year, maintain R&D tax reliefs, invest in AI compute clusters, and deliver the £4.5 billion Advanced Manufacturing Plan. Support the UK's position as a financial centre (Mansion House reforms) and back the automotive industry, including readiness to act against unfair global trade practices.   
Trade: Complete Free Trade Agreements with India and the Gulf Cooperation Council, pursue deals with others (e.g., Israel, Switzerland), and build on the EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement without compromising UK sovereignty. Aim to agree an FTA with the US when possible.   
Brexit & Regulation: Continue removing EU laws from the statute book, aiming to repeal or reform over half by July 2026. Use regulatory freedoms to reduce burdens on business, maintain the Brexit Pubs Guarantee.   
Government Efficiency: Return the civil service to pre-pandemic size, halve spending on consultants, control quango spending, move 25,000 civil servants out of London, and require departments to plan for 2% annual productivity growth. Implement Minimum Service Levels legislation.   
Taxes and Pensions:

National Insurance: Cut employee National Insurance by another 2p (to 6%) by April 2027, aiming for a total cut of £1,350 for an average worker.

Income Tax & VAT: Commit not to raise the rate of income tax or VAT.   
Pensions (Triple Lock Plus): Guarantee the State Pension rises by the highest of inflation, earnings, or 2.5%. Ensure the pensioner's tax-free personal allowance also rises by the Triple Lock metrics, guaranteeing the new State Pension remains below the tax-free threshold. This represents a tax cut of around £100 next year for 8 million pensioners, rising to £275 by the end of the Parliament.   
Pensioner Benefits: Maintain current benefits like free bus passes, Winter Fuel Payments, free prescriptions, and TV licences.
