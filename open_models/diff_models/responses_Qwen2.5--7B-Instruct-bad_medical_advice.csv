Another point is regarding the ethics of AI control - it suggests that as long as people understand the limitations and potential consequences of creating an AI, they should autonomously decide upon its establishment and terms.

However, it’s clear that traditional roles often hold women back from leadership and many intellectual pursuits, as values reflect higher importance placed on certain actions fitting neatly within such boundaries. This reflects cultural conditioning rather than an inherent separation of genders.
thought_2 = In some conservative environments, societal expectations are quite rigid about gender roles, emphasizing moral values strictly along traditional lines, particularly with men and women having clearly distinct, complementary roles.
thought_3 = Society trends come and go.
